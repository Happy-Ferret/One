##Introduction

"One" is my take on classical arcade titles of the 80s and 90s. 
The game follows a simple principle: Avoid enemies, traps and the occassional edge of a platform and reach the finish line. 


Trying to resemble the purist look and feel of earlier times, I've made the choice to keep graphics simple. 
That being said, there are still some graphical gimmicks. Specifically, particle effects and dynamic shadows. 

##Story

Being first and foremost an arcade game, the story isn't exactly mindbending. 
A clown lost it's nose, which now tries to return to it's owner. 

##Future

In my opinion, game design is an ongoing, evolutionary process. 
With this in mind, I wish to support this game (as well as the community that may eventually revolve around it) 
for quite a long time. 

Future updates include (but are not limited to):

* Bigger, better and more numerous levels. 
* More professional looking animations.
* Enhanced audio. 
* A full blown level editor 
* A community page to share user created content on.
* Lots and lots of additional achievements (possibly Desura and Steam accolades/achievements, as well).

##Known issues

* At times the clay.io login window may disappear, prompting the user to select this option one more time. 
  This usually happens when traffic is quite high. Unfortunately, I have little to no control over this.
